The food industry generates massive amounts of data every day — ratings, pricing, cuisines, locations, customer behavior.
This project explores restaurant data and transforms it into actionable insights that can help restaurant owners, food apps, and investors make smarter decisions.

Instead of just analyzing numbers, this project answers real business questions like:
• What makes a restaurant successful?
• Do expensive restaurants really get better ratings?
• Which cuisines dominate the market?
• How does location influence popularity?

This is not just analysis — this is data storytelling.

🎯 Objectives

✔ Clean and preprocess raw restaurant dataset
✔ Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
✔ Discover hidden trends and patterns
✔ Visualize insights in a simple and powerful way
